# About the Project

**"The Hosts Change, The Fever Remains"** is more than just a book; it is a **digital artifact**.

Inspired by the concept of "suicidal optimism"—the cyclical hope that changing leaders will solve systemic rot—this project employs an interactive web format to engage readers deeply. Instead of static text, it uses cinematic design and interactive data to confront the reader with the stark reality of Kenya's political landscape.

### Philosophy

The project posits that true political understanding requires confronting uncomfortable truths. Data, presented clearly and interactively, strips away the rhetoric and reveals the structural patterns beneath the surface. By combining narrative storytelling with raw data, this work aims to foster a more informed and clearer-eyed citizenship.
