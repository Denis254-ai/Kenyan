## 📖 Overview

**"The Hosts Change, The Fever Remains"** is a digital political manifesto and data-driven analysis of the Kenyan political landscape. It explores the cyclical nature of corruption, tribalism, and voter "suicidal optimism"—the persistent belief that changing leaders (hosts) will cure the systemic disease (fever).

This project transforms the traditional book format into a **cinematic, interactive web experience**, leveraging modern web technologies to present data and narratives in a visually compelling way.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Cinematic Dark Theme**: A fully immersive reading experience designed with a deep black palette and "Fever Red" accents to reflect the book's intense subject matter.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: 7 dynamic charts powered by **Chart.js** replace static images, allowing readers to interact with key political data (voter turnout, corruption indices, debt crisis).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- **Scroll-Based Animations**: Sections fade in as you read, and statistics count up dynamically, creating an engaging flow.
- **Modern Typography**: Utilizing **Bebas Neue** for impactful headings and **Playfair Display** for elegant quotes.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (variables), Flexbox/Grid layouts, and CSS animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for scroll interactions, lazy loading, and chart rendering.
- **Chart.js**: Open-source library for interactive data visualization.
- **Google Fonts**: Merriweather, Bebas Neue, Playfair Display.
